### About Section Addition

Add this paragraph to your About section:
```
Recently built two AI orchestration projects showcasing different approaches:
• Resume Tailor AI: AWS Step Functions (deterministic, AWS-native)
• Scaffold AI: LangGraph (dynamic, framework-agnostic)

Both built to production standards with security gates, rate limiting, and comprehensive 
testing. This demonstrates my ability to rapidly learn new frameworks (LangGraph in 2 weeks) 
and evaluate architectural trade-offs beyond just AWS-native solutions.
```

### Experience Section

**Add as a project under "Personal Projects" or current role**:
```
Scaffold AI - AI Architecture Designer
Feb 2026 - Present

Built in 2 weeks to explore LangGraph as an alternative to AWS Step Functions for AI 
workflows. Demonstrates rapid learning of new frameworks (LangGraph, React 19, Next.js 15) 
and framework-agnostic development approach.

Key achievements:
• Multi-agent AI workflow with dynamic routing based on LLM responses
• Security gate that blocks insecure architectures (70/100 minimum score)
• 135+ tests with 50% coverage
• Multi-format IaC generation (CDK, CloudFormation, Terraform)
• Production patterns: rate limiting, input validation, approval gates

Technologies: LangGraph, AWS Bedrock, FastAPI, Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Python

## 📱 LinkedIn Post (Launch Announcement)

### Post Template
```
🚀 Just open-sourced Scaffold AI - an AI-powered AWS architecture designer!

After building Resume Tailor AI with AWS Step Functions, I wanted to explore modern AI 
orchestration frameworks. Built this in 2 weeks with LangGraph, React 19, and Next.js 15 
(all new to me) to showcase rapid learning and framework diversity.

🎯 Key highlights:
✅ Multi-agent workflow with dynamic routing (vs static state machines)
✅ Security gate that blocks insecure architectures before code generation
✅ 135+ tests with production patterns (rate limiting, validation, approval gates)
✅ Multi-format IaC output (CDK, CloudFormation, Terraform)

🔄 Portfolio narrative:
This complements my Resume Tailor AI project, showcasing both AWS-native (Step Functions) 
and framework-based (LangGraph) orchestration approaches. I can now articulate trade-offs 
and choose the right tool based on requirements.

💡 Why LangGraph over Step Functions?
• Dynamic routing based on LLM response content
• 10x faster local development (no AWS deployment needed)
• Built-in state management and memory
• Better suited for conversational AI flows

📊 Tech stack:
LangGraph, AWS Bedrock (Claude 3), FastAPI, Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Python

### Engagement Strategy
**After posting**:
1. Respond to all comments within 24 hours
2. Ask follow-up questions to encourage discussion
3. Share in relevant LinkedIn groups (AWS, Python, AI/ML)
4. Tag relevant connections who might be interested
5. Repost after 1 week with additional insights

## 🎯 Interview Preparation

### Resume Talking Points

**"Tell me about Scaffold AI"**
"I built this in 2 weeks to learn LangGraph, React 19, and Next.js 15 - all frameworks I 
hadn't used before. After building Resume Tailor AI with AWS Step Functions, I wanted to 
explore alternatives for AI workflows. This showcases my ability to rapidly learn new 
technologies and evaluate architectural trade-offs."

**"Why did you build this?"**
"Two reasons: First, to demonstrate rapid learning of unfamiliar frameworks. Second, to 
showcase framework diversity - I now have experience with both AWS-native (Step Functions) 
and framework-based (LangGraph) orchestration, and I can articulate when to use each."

**"What's the difference from Resume Tailor AI?"**
"Resume Tailor AI uses AWS Step Functions for deterministic workflows - great for 
predictable, AWS-native flows. Scaffold AI uses LangGraph for dynamic AI routing - better 
for conversational AI where routing depends on LLM responses. Both have production patterns 
like security gates and rate limiting, but different orchestration approaches."

**"What did you learn?"**
"Three key things: First, LangGraph's built-in state management is much simpler than 
managing S3/DynamoDB. Second, local development is 10x faster without AWS deployment. 
Third, dynamic routing based on LLM content is powerful but requires careful error handling."
