## 🎯 Key Narrative

### Portfolio Message
"Built two AI orchestration projects in ~3 weeks:

- **Scaffold AI**: LangGraph (new frameworks, 1 day)

This showcases rapid learning, framework diversity, and ability to evaluate architectural trade-offs."

### Interview Talking Points
1. **Rapid Learning**: "Mastered LangGraph, React 19, Next.js 15 in 1 day"
2. **Framework Diversity**: "Can use both AWS-native and framework-based orchestration"
3. **Architectural Judgment**: "Can articulate trade-offs and choose the right tool"
4. **Production Mindset**: "Security gates, rate limiting, 135+ tests in both projects"
