## 📊 Portfolio Narrative

### The Story
"After building Resume Tailor AI with AWS Step Functions (familiar), I built Scaffold AI in 2 weeks with LangGraph, React 19, and Next.js 15 (all new frameworks). This showcases my ability to rapidly learn new technologies and choose the right orchestration approach for the use case."

### Key Differentiators
1. **Learning Velocity**: 2 weeks with unfamiliar frameworks
2. **Framework Diversity**: AWS-native vs framework-agnostic
3. **Architectural Judgment**: Can articulate trade-offs
4. **Production Mindset**: Same patterns in both projects
5. **Self-Awareness**: Critical review shows production thinking

### Interview Talking Points
- **Rapid learning**: How I mastered LangGraph in 2 weeks
- **Framework comparison**: When to use Step Functions vs LangGraph
- **Production patterns**: Security gates, rate limiting, testing
- **Trade-off analysis**: Cost, testing, development speed
- **Growth mindset**: Deliberately chose unfamiliar frameworks
