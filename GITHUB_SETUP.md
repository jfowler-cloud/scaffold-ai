## 📱 Social Sharing

### LinkedIn Post Template
```
🚀 Just open-sourced Scaffold AI - an AI-powered AWS architecture designer!

After building Resume Tailor AI with AWS Step Functions, I wanted to explore modern AI orchestration frameworks. Built this in 2 weeks to showcase:

✅ LangGraph multi-agent workflows
✅ Dynamic routing (vs static state machines)
✅ Rapid learning of new frameworks (React 19, Next.js 15)
✅ Production patterns (security gates, rate limiting, testing)

Key highlight: Security gate that blocks insecure architectures before code generation.

Tech stack: LangGraph, AWS Bedrock, FastAPI, Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Python

This complements my Resume Tailor AI project - showcasing both AWS-native (Step Functions) and framework-based (LangGraph) orchestration approaches.
